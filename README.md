# Data-Proffessional-Survey-Data-Analysis
In this project I used the survey data from Alex Freberg .. I cleaned the data using python pandas &amp; numpy before exporting the data back as an Excel file to be used for final analysis and visualization on PowerBI

Inspiration for this project is gotten from Alex Freberg big thanks to him.!!!!

### Analytics Process

* I downloaded the dataset from the link above.
* I used Jupyter notebook & python to clean the dataset and also do some feature engineering.
* After I finished cleaning I exported the data from my notebook to back to the excel format which I will be using for my final analysis/viz..
