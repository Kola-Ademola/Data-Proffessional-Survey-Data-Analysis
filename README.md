# Data-Proffessional-Survey-Data-Analysis
In this project I used the survey data from Alex Freberg .. I cleaned the data using python pandas &amp; numpy before exporting the data back as an Excel file to be used for final analysis and visualization on PowerBI

### Analytics Process

* I downloaded the dataset from the link above.
* I used Jupyter notebook & python to clean the dataset and also do some feature engineering.
* After I finished cleaning I exported the data from my notebook to back to the excel format which I will be using for my final analysis/viz..
