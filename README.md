## INTRODUCTION
___
Inspiration for this project is gotten from Alex Freberg big thanks to him.!!!! For this project I used the survey data Alex Freberg collected from a survey of Data professionals.. 

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

I cleaned the data using python pandas &amp; numpy before exporting the data back as an Excel file to be used for final analysis and visualization on PowerBI

### Analytics Process

* I downloaded the dataset from the link above.
* I used Jupyter notebook & python to clean the dataset and also do some feature engineering.
* After I finished cleaning I exported the data from my notebook to back to the excel format which I will be using for my final analysis/viz..
